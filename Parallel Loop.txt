Running two loops *in parallel* means you want to execute them **concurrently** so both keep working without blocking each other.

In Python, you have a few ways to do this:

---

## 1. **Using `threading` (Threads)**

Great for I/O-bound tasks (waiting, sleeping, reading input).

### Example:

```python
import threading
import time

def loop1():
    while True:
        print("Loop 1")
        time.sleep(1)

def loop2():
    while True:
        print("Loop 2")
        time.sleep(1.5)

# Create threads
t1 = threading.Thread(target=loop1)
t2 = threading.Thread(target=loop2)

# Start threads
t1.start()
t2.start()

# (Optional) Wait for threads to finish (they won’t in infinite loops)
# t1.join()
# t2.join()
```

Both loops print their messages concurrently.

## 2. **Using `multiprocessing` (Processes)**

Better for CPU-bound work, avoids Python’s Global Interpreter Lock (GIL).

```python
from multiprocessing import Process
import time

def loop1():
    while True:
        print("Loop 1")
        time.sleep(1)

def loop2():
    while True:
        print("Loop 2")
        time.sleep(1.5)

p1 = Process(target=loop1)
p2 = Process(target=loop2)

p1.start()
p2.start()

# p1.join()
# p2.join()
```

---

## 3. **Using `asyncio` (Async/Await)**

If your loops can be async (mostly waiting for I/O):

```python
import asyncio

async def loop1():
    while True:
        print("Loop 1")
        await asyncio.sleep(1)

async def loop2():
    while True:
        print("Loop 2")
        await asyncio.sleep(1.5)

async def main():
    await asyncio.gather(loop1(), loop2())

asyncio.run(main())
```

## Which to Choose?

| Method            | Best for                | Notes                     |
| ----------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `threading`       | I/O-bound, simple tasks | Lightweight, easy to use  |
| `multiprocessing` | CPU-bound heavy tasks   | Separate memory space     |
| `asyncio`         | Async I/O, network, GUI | Requires async-aware code |

### 💡 How to Use These in Python

You can just copy and paste them directly into your Python code as strings (Python 3+ supports Unicode fully):

```python
print("✅ Success!")
print("❌ Error: Something went wrong.")
print("💡 Tip: Use a virtual environment.")
```

They’ll display correctly in most terminals that support UTF-8.
